         Virtual reality fitness tech
      </header>
      <p class="paragraph">
         <em>Virtual reality fitness tech</em>, often known as VR fitness, is a type of training that employs technology to immerse people in a new, virtual workout environment in which your body serves as the controller. That means if your avatar in a boxing game has to throw some punches, you'll be doing it in real life as well. With the emergence of smart fitness tech, several fitness studios are now streaming even a sport like boxing to members online that require personalized training so that virtual reality opens up new avenues for people to get in <strong>shape</strong>.

           Fitness trackers
        </header>

         <p class="paragraph">
           <em>Fitness trackers</em>, the modern successor to pedometers, are the next generation of wearable fitness technology. Steps taken, heart rate, calories burnt, and a variety of other fitness data are tracked. Wearable Fitness technology such as FitBit's range of fitness trackers increasingly integrate smartwatch features including phone notification alerts, and smartwatches contain a variety of fitness tracking options and capabilities. Fitness trackers, on the other hand, are less expensive since they have fewer features and emphasis is on usefulness rather than aesthetics.

          The Global Fitness App
        </header>

         <p class="paragraph">
           <em>The Global Fitness App</em> Market is expanding due to the growing number of smartphone users and continuous advancements in fitness technology. In order to deliver tailored exercise regimens to their clients, fitness apps use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technologies. They also give individual health coaches, as well as no-equipment fitness regimens, tailored diet charts, diet monitoring, and tracking footsteps. As a result of these benefits, the market's growth potential has increased. MyFitness Pal, for example, offers tailored diet and exercise tracking to its users with the smart use of fitness technology. In June 2020, this app generated USD 6.7 million in income.
