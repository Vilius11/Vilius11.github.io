      <p>
         New technological innovations are regularly changing the way we exercise, which then over time creates a transformation within the health and fitness industry. People today who work out are not satisfied by only knowing their weight, height, waist line etc. They are interested in knowing more about their day to day progress, food macro and calorie consumption, body-fat percentage, sleep quality, calories burned, heart rate, etc. It is exciting and motivating when then receive this knowledge about themselves. With continuously checking their cardio machine's screens to calculate time and calories burnt, they want to keep a tab on themselves throughout the day, even when they are not at the gym or working out. These people are not only avid gym-goers, athletes or bodybuilders, but also include regular people who desire to be fit and exercise to maintain a balanced weight and active lifestyle.

It offers an immersive and fun experience, plunging users into amazing environments.

         In the near future, you might squeeze in a sweat session while picking up some milk.Your local gym will be tucked inside the local market, perhaps just a few feet away from the produce section. There you’ll don a lightweight VR headset and pedal your way through a virtual exotic world as trackers count your every moment. When you’re done, your phone will ping you to book a massage—it’ll know exactly which muscles are aching.It’s not that far off: Today’s health-club sector offers the utmost in convenience and personalization, in part due to AI-enabled technology. And with consumers taking a far bigger interest in health and wellness, clubs are growing faster and more innovative than ever: Gyms experienced a 50% increase in revenue in the past decade, reports the Global Wellness Institute.
